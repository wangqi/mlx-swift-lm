// MARK: - Concurrent weight loading

// MLX's safetensors loader is lazy: `loadArraysAndMetadata` reads only the header, and a
// tensor's bytes are read when its array is evaluated. A single `eval` of everything
// serializes that I/O and the copies into unified memory no matter how fast the disk is.
// Splitting each file into contiguous byte-balanced ranges and evaluating the ranges from
// concurrent `eval` calls overlaps read, copy, and allocation. Measured on an M4 Pro
// (14 cores, 5 GB shards, NVMe at ~6.1 GB/s sequential): the serial loader moves ~3-4.5 GB/s
// while the concurrent one reaches the disk ceiling cold (~5.9 GB/s) and >10 GB/s from the
// page cache -- a 30-45% faster cold load, about 2x warm. `F_RDADVISE`/read-ahead variants
// measured *slower* than the serial baseline because the advised I/O competes with the
// loader's own reads.
