# MLX Swift LM

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The `main` branch is a _new_ major version number: 3.x.  In order
> to decouple from tokenizer and downloader packages some breaking

MLX Swift LM is a Swift package to build tools and applications with large language models (LLMs) and vision language models (VLMs) in [MLX Swift](https://github.com/ml-explore/mlx-swift).

Some key features include:

- Model loading with integrations for a variety of tokenizer and model downloading packages.
- Low-rank (LoRA) and full model fine-tuning with support for quantized models.
- Many model architectures for both LLMs and VLMs.

For some example applications and tools that use MLX Swift LM, check out [MLX Swift Examples](https://github.com/ml-explore/mlx-swift-examples).

## Usage

This package integrates with a variety of tokenizer and downloader packages through protocol conformance. Users can pick from three ways to integrate with these packages, which offer different tradeoffs between freedom and convenience:

- Maximum freedom
  - Copy the protocol conformance code (~100 lines) from the [integration packages](#Tokenizer-and-Downloader-Integrations)
- Freedom and convenience
  - Use the [integration packages](#Tokenizer-and-Downloader-Integrations) for your preferred tokenizer and downloader packages
- Convenience
  - Use the macros for integration with Swift Transformers and Swift Hugging Face

### Installation

Add the core package to your `Package.swift`:

```swift
.package(url: "https://github.com/ml-explore/mlx-swift-lm", branch: "main"),
```

Then add your preferred tokenizer and downloader integrations:

```swift
.package(url: "https://github.com/DePasqualeOrg/swift-tokenizers-mlx", from: "0.1.0"),
.package(url: "https://github.com/DePasqualeOrg/swift-hf-api-mlx", from: "0.1.0"),
```

And add the libraries to your target:

```swift
.target(
    name: "YourTargetName",
    dependencies: [
        .product(name: "MLXLLM", package: "mlx-swift-lm"),
        .product(name: "MLXLMTokenizers", package: "swift-tokenizers-mlx"),
        .product(name: "MLXLMHuggingFace", package: "swift-hf-api-mlx"),
    ]),
```

### Tokenizer and Downloader Integrations

Tokenization and model downloading are handled by separate packages. Adapters make it easy to use your preferred tokenizer and downloader packages. For instructions on how to use them, see the readmes in the respective packages.

> **Note:** The adapters are offered for convenience and are not required. You can also use tokenizer and downloader packages directly by setting up the required protocol conformance for MLX Swift LM, just like the code in the integration packages. Alternatively, you can use the macros provided by this package to integrate with Swift Transformers and Swift Hugging Face.

### Quick Start

You can get started with a wide variety of open-weights LLMs and VLMs using this simplified API (for more details, see  [MLXLMCommon](Libraries/MLXLMCommon)):

```swift
import MLXLLM
import MLXLMHuggingFace
import MLXLMTokenizers

let model = try await loadModel(
    from: HubClient.default,
    using: TokenizersLoader(),
    id: "mlx-community/Qwen3-4B-4bit"
)
let session = ChatSession(model)
print(try await session.respond(to: "What are two things to see in San Francisco?"))
print(try await session.respond(to: "How about a great place to eat?"))
```

Loading from a local directory:

```swift
import MLXLLM
import MLXLMTokenizers

let modelDirectory = URL(filePath: "/path/to/model")
let container = try await loadModelContainer(
    from: modelDirectory,
    using: TokenizersLoader()
)
```

Use a custom Hugging Face client:

```swift
import MLXLLM
import MLXLMHuggingFace
import MLXLMTokenizers

let hub = HubClient(token: "hf_...")
let container = try await loadModelContainer(
    from: hub,
    using: TokenizersLoader(),
    id: "mlx-community/Qwen3-4B-4bit"
)
```

Use a custom downloader:

```swift
import MLXLLM
import MLXLMCommon
import MLXLMTokenizers

struct S3Downloader: Downloader {
    func download(
        id: String,
        revision: String?,
        matching patterns: [String],
        useLatest: Bool,
        progressHandler: @Sendable @escaping (Progress) -> Void
    ) async throws -> URL {
        // Download files and return a local directory URL.
        return URL(filePath: "/tmp/model")
    }
}

let container = try await loadModelContainer(
    from: S3Downloader(),
    using: TokenizersLoader(),
    id: "my-bucket/my-model"
)
```

Or use the underlying API to control every aspect of the evaluation.

## Migrating to Version 3

Version 3 of MLX Swift LM decouples the tokenizer and downloader implementations. See the [integrations](#Tokenizer-and-Downloader-Integrations) section for details.

### New dependencies

Add your preferred tokenizer and downloader adapters:

```swift
// Before (2.x) – single dependency
.package(url: "https://github.com/ml-explore/mlx-swift-lm/", from: "2.30.0"),

// After (3.x) – core + adapters
.package(url: "https://github.com/ml-explore/mlx-swift-lm/", from: "3.0.0"),
.package(url: "https://github.com/DePasqualeOrg/swift-tokenizers-mlx/", from: "0.1.0"),
.package(url: "https://github.com/DePasqualeOrg/swift-hf-api-mlx/", from: "0.1.0"),
```

And add their products to your target:

```swift
.product(name: "MLXLMTokenizers", package: "swift-tokenizers-mlx"),
.product(name: "MLXLMHFAPI", package: "swift-hf-api-mlx"),

// If you use MLXEmbedders:
.product(name: "MLXEmbeddersTokenizers", package: "swift-tokenizers-mlx"),
.product(name: "MLXEmbeddersHFAPI", package: "swift-hf-api-mlx"),
```

### New imports

```swift
// Before (2.x)
import MLXLLM

// After (3.x)
import MLXLLM
import MLXLMHFAPI      // Downloader adapter
import MLXLMTokenizers // Tokenizer adapter
```

If you use MLXEmbedders:

```swift
import MLXEmbedders
import MLXEmbeddersHFAPI      // Downloader adapter
import MLXEmbeddersTokenizers // Tokenizer adapter
```

### Loading API changes

The core APIs now include a `from:` parameter of type `URL` or `any Downloader` as well as a `using:` parameter for the tokenizer loader. Tokenizer integration packages may supply convenience methods with a default tokenizer loader, allowing you to omit the `using:` parameter.

The most visible call-site changes are:

- `hub:` → `from:`: Models are now loaded from a directory `URL` or  `Downloader`.
- `HubApi` → `HubClient`: A new implementation of the Hugging Face Hub client is used.

Example when downloading from Hugging Face:

```swift
// Before (2.x) – hub defaulted to HubApi()
let container = try await loadModelContainer(
    id: "mlx-community/Qwen3-4B-4bit"
)

// After (3.x) – Using Swift Hugging Face + Swift Tokenizers
let container = try await loadModelContainer(
    from: HubClient.default,
    id: "mlx-community/Qwen3-4B-4bit"
)
```

At the lower-level core API, you can still pass any `Downloader` and any `TokenizerLoader` explicitly.

Loading from a local directory:

```swift
// Before (2.x)
let container = try await loadModelContainer(directory: modelDirectory)

// After (3.x)
let container = try await loadModelContainer(from: modelDirectory)
```

Loading with a model factory:

```swift
let container = try await LLMModelFactory.shared.loadContainer(
    from: HubClient.default,
    configuration: modelConfiguration
)
```

Loading an embedder:

```swift
import MLXEmbedders
import MLXEmbeddersHFAPI
import MLXEmbeddersTokenizers

let container = try await loadModelContainer(
    from: HubClient.default,
    configuration: .configuration(id: "sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2")
)
```

### Renamed methods

`decode(tokens:)` is renamed to `decode(tokenIds:)` to align with the `transformers` library in Python:

```swift
// Before (2.x)
let text = tokenizer.decode(tokens: ids)

// After (3.0)
let text = tokenizer.decode(tokenIds: ids)
```

## Breaking Changes

### Loading API

The `hub` parameter (previously `HubApi`) has been replaced with `from` (any `Downloader` or `URL` for a local directory). Functions that previously defaulted to `defaultHubApi` no longer have a default – callers must either pass a `Downloader` explicitly or use the convenience methods in `MLXLMHuggingFace` / `MLXEmbeddersHuggingFace`, which default to `HubClient.default`.

For most users who were using the default Hub client, adding `import MLXLMHuggingFace` or `import MLXEmbeddersHuggingFace` and using the convenience overloads is sufficient.

Users who were passing a custom `HubApi` instance should create a `HubClient` instead and pass it as the `from` parameter. `HubClient` conforms to `Downloader` via `MLXLMHuggingFace`.

### `ModelConfiguration`

- `tokenizerId` and `overrideTokenizer` have been replaced by `tokenizerSource: TokenizerSource?`, which supports `.id(String)` for remote sources and `.directory(URL)` for local paths.
- `preparePrompt` has been removed. This shouldn't be used anyway, since support for chat templates is available.
- `modelDirectory(hub:)` has been removed. For local directories, pass the `URL` directly to the loading functions. For remote models, the `Downloader` protocol handles resolution.

### Tokenizer loading

`loadTokenizer(configuration:hub:)` has been removed. Tokenizer loading now uses `AutoTokenizer.from(directory:)` from Swift Tokenizers directly.

`replacementTokenizers` (the `TokenizerReplacementRegistry`) has been removed. Use `AutoTokenizer.register(_:for:)` from Swift Tokenizers instead.

### `defaultHubApi`

The `defaultHubApi` global has been removed. Hugging Face Hub access is now provided by `HubClient.default` from the `HuggingFace` module.

### Low-level APIs

- `downloadModel(hub:configuration:progressHandler:)` → `Downloader.download(id:revision:matching:useLatest:progressHandler:)`
- `loadTokenizerConfig(configuration:hub:)` → `AutoTokenizer.from(directory:)`
- `ModelFactory._load(hub:configuration:progressHandler:)` → `_load(configuration: ResolvedModelConfiguration)`
- `ModelFactory._loadContainer`: removed (base `loadContainer` now builds the container from `_load`)
